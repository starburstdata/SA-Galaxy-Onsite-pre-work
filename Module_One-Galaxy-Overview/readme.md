Module 1 is the Basic Starburst Galaxy overview module. The module is designed to provide an introduction to the Galaxy SaaS platform for your lab attendees. 
The module will cover the following areas:

- Basic Galaxy Architecture [5-10 Mins] Slides
  - We recommend walking through this section with the pre-built slides.
- Galaxy Usecases [5-10 Mins] Slides
  - Adhoc / Interactive / Business Intelligence
  - ETL/ELT
  - Embed

- Galaxy UI Walkthrough [10 Mins] 
  - We recommend walking through Galaxy UI Live by sharing your screen and driving through the UI. A "how-to" video provided in UI Overview Folder is provided as an example.

- How to create a Catalog [10 Mins] Demo
  - Reference "Create S3 Catalog" PDF in this directory for your demo if you need a refresher
  - Reference "Create Database Catalog" PDF in this directory for your demo if you need a refresher
 
- Break the audience into their groups and Create their group catalogs
  - Have the audience get into their groups
  - Have the audience choose one person to login and following the instructions slide create their group S3 Catalog

To squeeze all of the above topics into the first hour, we have intentionally not had the lab attendees login to Galaxy yet and be distracted during this overview. At the end of the overview module, they will break into groups and create a catalog. The next module will utilize the newly created catalog for Schema Discovery, Data Product creation, and Data Discovery.
