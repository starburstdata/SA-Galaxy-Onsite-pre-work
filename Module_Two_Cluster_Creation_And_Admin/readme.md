Module 2 is a general cluster creation and administration module. The module is designed to provide an introduction to the process of creating/managing clusters and catalogs within the Galaxy SaaS platform. 

The module will cover the following areas:

- Attaching Catalogs [10-15 Mins] Slides

- Cluster Mode Types [10-15 Mins] Slides

- Connecting to a Cluster [5-10 Mins] Slides

At this point in the process, attendees will generally already have access to the Domain and be able to walkthrough many of the steps in the deck above by themselves. Because of this, we recommend allocating a full hour to this session to handle any troubleshooting issues that may arise.
